Playstop E-commerce site

Playstop is a fictional company in Singapore that sells games, consoles and other gaming peripheral, similiar to real-life stores in Singapore such as TOY OR GAME or GameStop in the United States. Though Playstop has a physical store, it wants to reach a broader audience. Though physical game stores are still quite popular with the youth, a large percentage of gamers now prefer to shop online. Hence, PlayStop has now decided to open up a website, where it hopes to bring in new audiences as well as retain its shoppers.

# Design Process:
As stated above, this website is for gamers that patronise Playstop and also gamers that prefer to buy their games online. The website helps Playstop in reaching a broader audience as many gamers do not like going to the physical store to purchase games, it also helps to trivialise the game buying process. This is evident in the fact that many gamers now own digital copies of the game rather than the physical ones, hence, I can infer that they prefer buying games online. That is why Playstop is now opening a website that displays their physical stock online so that these gamers might choose to purchase them online instead.

I believe a website is the best way to achieve such a goal as many physical game stores out there such as TOY OR GAME and GameStop have websites that show their physical stock, and also so that they can receive pre-orders through the website.

I also wanted to implement a trade-in system to incentivise more gamers to shop at Playstop.

Personally, as a gamer myself, I much prefer to shop for games online anyway due to the convenience. Hence, I think this goal of making buying games a convenience is relatable.

# Features:
-Navigation bar-allows users to cycle through different tabs in the website for easy access

-Slideshow at home screen-grabs users' attention immediately through the different visuals of the different games, this might entice users to purchase those games. 


-Product containers-the product containers in the games and hardware pages gives users a clean and neat look at all of Playstop's products, which allows them to weight their options carefully and see which game they might want to purchase, boosting Playstop's sales. The product containers are displayed in a grid format in CSS.


-Side-scrolling bar-allows users to have a glimpse at what games are Pre-Orders and have just newly arrived respectively, this might entice users to pre-order the games which would boost sales.

-Store-locater in "Trade-in" page-allows users to look up where Playstop outlets are so that they can plan a route to the physical store, enabling them to either shop there or trade-in their used items. This also boosts Playstop's sales.

-Order instructions text box at "my cart" page-Playstop allows users to input any special instructions they might have when purchasing items, this gives users options to customise their order at checkout. For example, a user might want their PS5 to be wrapped for a birthday gift. This gives users more options when they are purchasing their item, which leads users to be impressed by Playstop's customer service, boosting sales.

-Trade-in form-The trade-in form allows users to input what item they are trading in, it's current condition, and the quantity. This allows Playstop to verify the item before approving of the user's trade-in, so that the user does not trade-in an item that the shop cannot accept. The user's responses are also displayed on the page after they hit the submit button.

-Side nav bar-Allows users to navigate through the three different tabs (Playstation, Nintendo, X Box)of hardware/games, this makes navigation of the website even easier in combination with the top nav bar.



# Features Left to Implement
-Add a receipt page after user checks out, where it will display the total bill and also the special instructions the user had input.


# Technologies used:
-Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE): IIFE was used in my slideshow function code to trigger the slideshow the moment the user enters the website. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/immediately-invoked-function-expressions-iife-in-javascript/

# Testing:

1. Trade-in form:
  i.  Go to the trade-in page
  ii. Click the trade-in form button
  iii.Enter the three answers for the three questions
  iv. Hit submit
  v.  User's value are displayed correctly below the short form

My project works in Edge and Chrome as intended. 

However, when I adjust the screen size, the navigation bar at the top tends to get squeezed, causing it to not cover the entire screen.

3. Aknowledgements

-This project is largely inspired by TOY OR GAME and its website. I tried to recapture the website's look and simplified it, which you can see from the grid-like display of the product containers and the slide show. 

-The trade-in aspect of the website is inspired by GameStop's trade-in system. The inspiration for the trade-in website came from their site: https://www.gamestop.com/trade/
