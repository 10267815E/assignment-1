Playstop E-commerce site

Playstop is a fictional company in Singapore that sells games, consoles and other gaming peripheral, similiar to real-life stores in Singapore such as TOY OR GAME or GameStop in the United States. Though Playstop has a physical store, it wants to reach a broader audience. Though physical game stores are still quite popular with the youth, a large percentage of gamers now prefer to shop online. Hence, PlayStop has now decided to open up a website, where it hopes to bring in new audiences as well as retain its shoppers.

Design Process:
As stated above, this website is for gamers that patronise Playstop and also gamers that prefer to buy their games online. The website helps Playstop in reaching a broader audience as many gamers do not like going to the physical store to purchase games, it also helps to trivialise the game buying process. This is evident in the fact that many gamers now own digital copies of the game rather than the physical ones, hence, I can infer that they prefer buying games online. That is why Playstop is now opening a website that displays their physical stock online so that these gamers might choose to purchase them online instead.

I believe a website is the best way to achieve such a goal as many physical game stores out there such as TOY OR GAME and GameStop have websites that show their physical stock, and also so that they can receive pre-orders through the website.

I also wanted to implement a trade-in system to incentivise more gamers to shop at Playstop.

Personally, as a gamer myself, I much prefer to shop for games online anyway due to the convenience. Hence, I think this goal of making buying games a convenience is relatable.

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
